## Website researched
The primary function of this website is to search for nearby carparks around the current location and also around which ever location the user chooses. I chose this idea for the assingnment as I found it interesting how the api can work using real time data.
For my research, the webpages that I have referenced is **[Parkopedia](https://www.parkopedia.com/)** and **[Google Map](https://www.google.com.sg/maps)** After researching, I went to look for suitable APIs that fit my needs. I came accross Google API, Mapbox API and decided to choose them as it had a clear API doucmentation I design it this way as I refer to the design of Parkopedia, which also has same purpose of my website.

## Website catering
The target audience are the people who drives or whoever that wants to search for local car park near a specific location.

## How I want the website to be
I design it this way is to make my website easy to navigate and straightforward. I want to make this website as easy to use as possible therefore there are a lot of obvious signs on where to click on
